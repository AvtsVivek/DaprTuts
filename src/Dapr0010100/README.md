# Introduction 
Baby steps with Dapr
# Getting Started

This example is from here.

Do the following

1. dotnet restore
2. dotnet build

You need to run this app with dapr and not directly.
Do the following.
First start docker
Then initialize dapr with the following command
dapr init
Ensure state store is running as a docker container.
Once it is initialized, there are several ways to run the app.

Run the following command.
This will ask dapr to run this app.
dapr run --app-id DaprCounter dotnet run

You can run the poweshell script run-app.ps1 as well. It will run the same command.



Once the app is running, to view the state of the app, get into the container.
https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/get-started-api/#step-4-see-how-the-state-is-stored-in-redis
docker exec -it dapr_redis redis-cli
Here redis-cli is the command name that you need to execute inside of the container.
Once you are the redis cli, type 'keys *' to see the keys.
hgetall "DaprCounter || counter"
